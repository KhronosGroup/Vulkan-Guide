= Vulkan Profiles

Vulkan Profiles is a mechanism that allows developers to target a specific set of features, extensions, and limits that are guaranteed to be supported by a range of Vulkan implementations. This is particularly useful for cross-platform development where you want to ensure your application works consistently across different devices.

For detailed information, refer to the link:https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.321.0/windows/profiles_api_library.html[Vulkan Profiles API Library] documentation on LunarG's website.

== What are Vulkan Profiles?

A Vulkan Profile is a well-defined set of capabilities, (features, extensions, formats, queue families, etc.) that can be used as a baseline for application development. Profiles are defined in JSON format and can be used to:

* Simplify development by providing a known set of capabilities
* Ensure compatibility across a range of devices
* Reduce the need for complex capability checking and fallback code
* Provide a clear target for both developers and hardware vendors

The Khronos Group maintains a set of official profiles, and vendors can also
define their own profiles for their specific hardware. Additionally, Vulkan
application developers can create profiles to specify engine code paths, like
 Unreal Engine does. Or libraries such as Zink can specify their Vulkan requirements for OpenGL to run, enabling hardware vendors to prioritize their driver development to support specific code paths on engines or libraries.

=== History and Purpose

Vulkan Profiles were introduced to address the challenge of fragmentation in the Vulkan ecosystem. With many different devices supporting various combinations of features and extensions, developers faced difficulties in:

* Determining which features to target for maximum device compatibility
* Managing fallback paths for devices with limited capabilities
* Communicating requirements clearly to hardware vendors

Profiles solve these problems by providing a convention to define and reference sets of Vulkan capabilities. They serve as a contract between application developers and hardware vendors, ensuring that devices claiming support for a profile will provide all the capabilities defined in that profile.

=== Relationship with Vulkan Versions

Vulkan Profiles are complementary to Vulkan versions. While Vulkan versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.) define the core API functionality, profiles define specific subsets of features, extensions, and limits that may span across different Vulkan versions.

For example:

* The Android Baseline 2022 profile requires Vulkan 1.1 core functionality
* The LunarG Desktop Baseline 2022 profile for desktop platforms requires Vulkan 1.1 with specific extensions
* Future profiles may target newer Vulkan versions as they become more widely supported

This approach allows developers to target specific capability sets without being tied to a particular Vulkan version, providing more flexibility in application development.

== Official Profiles

The Khronos Group maintains several profiles, which are defined in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/tree/main/profiles[Vulkan-Profiles repository]. The only official profiles are the Khronos Roadmap profiles and the Android Baseline profile. The others are maintained by Google and LunarG:

* *LunarG Desktop Baseline 2022* - A baseline profile for desktop platforms
(link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/profiles/VP_LUNARG_desktop_baseline_2022[JSON Definitions])
* *Android Baseline 2022* - A baseline profile specifically for Android devices (link:https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.321.0/windows/profiles_api_library.html[Documentation], link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/profiles/VP_ANDROID_baseline_2022.json[JSON Definition])
* *Roadmap 2022* - A forward-looking profile that hardware vendors are encouraged to support in future implementations (link:https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.321.0/windows/profiles_api_library.html[Documentation], link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/profiles/VP_KHR_roadmap_2022.json[JSON Definition])

These profiles are versioned by year to allow for evolution over time while maintaining backward compatibility. You can find sample code demonstrating the use of these profiles in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/tooling/profiles[Vulkan-Samples repository].

=== LunarG Desktop Baseline 2022 Profile Details

The LunarG Desktop Baseline 2022 profile (`VP_LUNARG_DESKTOP_BASELINE_2022`) is designed for desktop platforms. It's described as "A profile generated by the intersection of a collection of GPUInfo.org device reports to support a large number of actual systems in the Vulkan ecosystem. This profile is meant to be a usage example for Vulkan application developers."

The real purpose of the LunarG Desktop Baseline profiles is to provide examples to Vulkan application developers to create profiles for their applications. It's important to note that these profiles have some limitations - for example, Windows ARM / Qualcomm GPUs are not supported because these GPUs were not released or just released when the profiles were generated.

If LunarG were to create a Desktop Baseline 2025 in the future, it would likely include Windows ARM / Qualcomm GPUs, which would make the Desktop Baseline 2025 both a subset and superset (likely Vulkan 1.3) of the Desktop Baseline 2024.

The profile includes:

* Core Vulkan 1.1 functionality
* Key extensions such as:
** `VK_KHR_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_maintenance2`, `VK_KHR_maintenance3`
** `VK_KHR_create_renderpass2`
** `VK_KHR_image_format_list`
** `VK_KHR_sampler_mirror_clamp_to_edge`
* Specific feature requirements include:
** `robustBufferAccess`
** `fullDrawIndexUint32`
** `imageCubeArray`
** `independentBlend`
** And many more core features

This profile ensures that applications focusing on it will work consistently across a wide range of desktop GPUs from different vendors.

=== Android Baseline 2022 Profile Details

The Android Baseline 2022 profile (`VP_ANDROID_BASELINE_2022`) is tailored specifically for Android devices and includes:

* Core Vulkan 1.1 functionality
* Android-specific extensions such as:
** `VK_KHR_android_surface`
** `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer`
* Common rendering extensions:
** `VK_KHR_swapchain`
** `VK_KHR_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_maintenance2`, `VK_KHR_maintenance3`
** `VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation`
* Mobile-optimized limits and features

This profile is particularly valuable for Android game developers who want to ensure their applications run on a wide range of Android devices without having to implement complex device-specific code paths.

=== Roadmap 2022 Profile

The Roadmap 2022 profile (`VP_KHR_ROADMAP_2022`) is a forward-looking profile that defines capabilities that hardware vendors are encouraged to support in future implementations. It includes:

* More advanced features and extensions beyond the baseline profiles
* Higher minimum limits for various resources
* Support for newer Vulkan functionality

By targeting this profile, developers can prepare their applications for future hardware capabilities while still maintaining compatibility with current devices through fallback mechanisms.

=== Profile Versioning Strategy

Profiles use a year-based versioning scheme (e.g., 2022, 2023) to indicate when they were defined. This approach:

* Provides clear temporal context for each profile
* Allows for the creation of new profiles that reflect evolving hardware capabilities
* Maintains backward compatibility, as older profiles remain valid even as
new ones are introduced.  This is a feature of the design of the profiles,
yet sometimes, there are rare instances where the older profiles are updated
due to newly released hardware.

When a new yearly profile is released, it typically includes all the capabilities of the previous year's profile plus additional features and possibly higher limits, reflecting the advancement of hardware capabilities.

== Using Vulkan Profiles

There are two main ways to use Vulkan Profiles to initialize a Vulkan application:

=== 1. Using the Vulkan Profiles header

The simplest way to use Vulkan Profiles is through the Vulkan Profiles header (`vulkan_profiles.hpp`), which is available in the link:https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home[Vulkan SDK]. This header provides a C++ API that simplifies working with profiles. The header is documented in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/tree/main[Vulkan-Profiles library documentation]:

[source,cpp]
----
#include <vulkan/vulkan.hpp>
#include <vulkan/vulkan_profiles.hpp>

// Create a profile instance for the Android baseline profile
vkp::AndroidBaseline2022Profile profile;

// Check if the profile is supported on this device
VkBool32 supported = VK_FALSE;
profile.CheckSupport(physicalDevice, &supported);
if (supported) {
    // The device supports the Android baseline profile
    // Use the profile to create a device
    VkDeviceCreateInfo deviceCreateInfo = {};
    profile.ConfigureDeviceCreation(physicalDevice, deviceCreateInfo);

    // Create the device with the profile-configured create info
    VkDevice device;
    vkCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &deviceCreateInfo, nullptr, &device);
}
----

=== 2. Using the Vulkan Profiles, JSON files directly

For more advanced use cases, you can work with the JSON profile definitions
directly. The JSON schema is documented in the link:https://github
.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/schema/README.md[Vulkan-Profiles
schema documentation]. You can find example code that loads and uses JSON
profiles in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/layer/TUTORIAL.md[Vulkan-Profiles]:

[source,cpp]
----
// Load a profile from a JSON file
VkpProfilesFileLoader loader;
loader.LoadFromFile("android_baseline_2022.json");

// Get the profile
VkpProfile profile = loader.GetProfile("VP_ANDROID_BASELINE_2022");

// Use the profile to check support and create a device
// (similar to the header-based approach)
----

=== Understanding Profile JSON Structure

Vulkan Profiles are defined in JSON format with a specific structure. Understanding this structure is important for developers who want to create custom profiles or modify existing ones. Here's a simplified example of a profile JSON structure:

[source,json]
----
{
    "file_format_version": "1.0.0",
    "profiles": {
        "VP_EXAMPLE_PROFILE": {
            "version": 1,
            "api_version": "1.1.0",
            "label": "Example Profile",
            "description": "A simple example profile",
            "capabilities": [
                {
                    "extensions": {
                        "VK_KHR_swapchain": 1,
                        "VK_KHR_maintenance1": 1
                    },
                    "features": {
                        "VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures": {
                            "robustBufferAccess": true,
                            "fullDrawIndexUint32": true
                        }
                    },
                    "properties": {
                        "VkPhysicalDeviceProperties": {
                            "limits": {
                                "maxImageDimension2D": 4096,
                                "maxFramebufferWidth": 4096
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    "formats": {
                        "VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM": {
                            "VkFormatProperties": {
                                "linearTilingFeatures": [
                                    "VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT"
                                ],
                                "optimalTilingFeatures": [
                                    "VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT",
                                    "VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT"
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
----

The key parts of a profile definition include:

* *Profile Metadata*: Name, version, API version, label, and description
* *Capabilities*: The core of the profile, defining what the profile supports
  * *Extensions*: Required extensions and their minimum versions
  * *Features*: Required features that must be supported
  * *Properties*: Required properties and limits
  * *Formats*: Required format support with specific capabilities

=== Creating Custom Profiles

Developers can create custom profiles to target specific hardware configurations or to define a baseline for their own applications. To create a custom profile:

There are two main use cases that define the starting point:

1. Creating a "Platform" profile - a profile that represents all the devices you want your Vulkan application to run on. Here, the starting point would be to use data from https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ when merging device capabilities.
2. Creating an "Engine" profile - a profile that lists all the requirements for your Vulkan application to run. In this case, modifying an existing profile is often the best approach.

Both approaches work together to ensure a Vulkan application can ship reliably.

To create a custom profile:

1. Start with an appropriate existing profile as a template (see link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/tree/main/profiles[profiles])
2. Modify the capabilities to match your requirements
3. Save the profile as a JSON file
4. Use the profile in your application using either the header-based or JSON-based approach

You can find examples of custom profiles in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/tooling/profiles[Vulkan-Samples profiles examples].

Custom profiles are particularly useful for:

* Internal development teams working on multiple applications
* Defining minimum requirements for specific application categories
* Creating hardware-specific optimized profiles

Example of creating and using a custom profile:

[source,cpp]
----
// Define a custom profile (typically done offline and saved to a JSON file)
std::string customProfileJson = R"(
{
    "file_format_version": "1.0.0",
    "profiles": {
        "VP_CUSTOM_GAME_PROFILE": {
            "version": 1,
            "api_version": "1.1.0",
            "label": "Custom Game Profile",
            "description": "Profile for our game engine",
            "capabilities": [
                // ... custom capabilities ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
)";

// Load the custom profile
VkpProfilesFileLoader loader;
loader.LoadFromString(customProfileJson);

// Use the custom profile
VkpProfile profile = loader.GetProfile("VP_CUSTOM_GAME_PROFILE");
// ... use the profile as before ...
----

== Android Baseline Profile

The Android Baseline Profile is particularly useful for Android developers as it provides a guaranteed set of features that are available on a wide range of Android devices. This profile is documented in the link:https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.321.0/windows/profiles_api_library.html[Vulkan Profiles API Library documentation] and the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/profiles/VP_ANDROID_baseline_2022.json[JSON definition]. This profile includes:

* Core Vulkan 1.1 functionality
* Essential extensions for Android development
* Minimum guaranteed limits and features


By targeting the Android Baseline Profile, developers can:

* Reduce the need for device-specific code paths
* Ensure consistent behavior across different Android devices
* Simplify testing and validation

=== Example: Targeting Android Baseline Profile

[source,cpp]
----
#include <vulkan/vulkan.hpp>
#include <vulkan/vulkan_profiles.hpp>

void SetupVulkanWithAndroidProfile() {
    // Create a Vulkan instance
    vk::InstanceCreateInfo instanceCreateInfo;
    vk::Instance instance = vk::createInstance(instanceCreateInfo);

    // Get a physical device
    vk::PhysicalDevice physicalDevice = instance.enumeratePhysicalDevices().front();

    // Create a profile instance for the Android baseline profile
    vkp::AndroidBaseline2022Profile profile;

    // Check if the profile is supported
    VkBool32 supported = VK_FALSE;
    profile.CheckSupport(physicalDevice, &supported);

    if (supported) {
        // Configure device creation with the profile
        vk::DeviceCreateInfo deviceCreateInfo;
        profile.ConfigureDeviceCreation(physicalDevice, deviceCreateInfo);

        // Create the device
        vk::Device device = physicalDevice.createDevice(deviceCreateInfo);

        // Now you can use the device with the guaranteed set of features
        // defined in the Android Baseline Profile
    } else {
        // Handle the case where the profile is not supported
        // This might involve falling back to a simpler rendering approach
        // or showing an error message
    }
}
----

== Integration with Existing Applications

Integrating Vulkan Profiles into an existing Vulkan application involves several steps, which are described in the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/library/README.md#integrating-with-existing-applications[Vulkan-Profiles library documentation]:

1. *Identify Target Profiles*: Determine which profiles best match your application's requirements
2. *Add Profile Support*: Incorporate the Vulkan Profiles header or JSON handling
3. *Modify Device Creation*: Update your device creation code to use profiles
4. *Add Fallback Paths*: Implement fallback strategies for devices that don't support your target profile

For examples of integrating profiles with existing applications, see the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/main/samples/tooling/profiles[Vulkan-Samples profiles examples] and the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/tree/main/library/test[Vulkan-Profiles test directory].

Here's an example of integrating profiles into an existing application:

[source,cpp]
----
// Original device creation code
void CreateDeviceOriginal(VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice) {
    // Query for features, extensions, etc.
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(physicalDevice, &features);

    // Set up device creation info manually
    VkDeviceCreateInfo createInfo = {};
    createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO;
    createInfo.pEnabledFeatures = &features;
    // ... set up extensions, queues, etc. ...

    // Create the device
    VkDevice device;
    vkCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &createInfo, nullptr, &device);
}

// Updated device creation code using profiles
void CreateDeviceWithProfiles(VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice) {
    // Try to use the LunarG Desktop Baseline 2022 profile
    vkp::LunargDesktopBaseline2022Profile profile;

    VkBool32 supported = VK_FALSE;
    profile.CheckSupport(physicalDevice, &supported);

    if (supported) {
        // Profile is supported, use it to configure device creation
        VkDeviceCreateInfo createInfo = {};
        createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO;

        profile.ConfigureDeviceCreation(physicalDevice, createInfo);

        // Create the device with profile-configured settings
        VkDevice device;
        vkCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &createInfo, nullptr, &device);
    } else {
        // Fall back to original method if profile is not supported
        CreateDeviceOriginal(physicalDevice);
    }
}
----

== Performance Considerations

Using Vulkan Profiles has minimal runtime performance impact, but there are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. *Initialization Overhead*: Loading and parsing profile JSON files adds some initialization time
2. *Memory Usage*: The profile data structures consume a small amount of memory
3. *Feature Enabling*: Enabling features you don't need might have a slight performance impact on some implementations

To optimize performance when using profiles:

* Use the header-based approach for better compile-time optimization
* Create custom profiles that only include the features you actually need
* Consider using different profiles for different hardware tiers

== Troubleshooting and Common Issues

When working with Vulkan Profiles, developers might encounter several common issues. The link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Profiles/blob/main/library/README.md#troubleshooting[Vulkan-Profiles library documentation] provides guidance on troubleshooting, and the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers/blob/main/docs/khronos_validation_layer.md[Vulkan Validation Layers documentation] can help identify issues with profile usage:

=== Profile Isn't Supported

If `CheckSupport()` returns `VK_FALSE`, it means the device doesn't support all the requirements of the profile. To troubleshoot:

1. Use the profile's `GetProfileCapabilitiesReport()` function to get detailed information about which specific requirements are not met
2. Consider using a less demanding profile
3. Implement a fallback path for devices that don't support your target profile

Example:

[source,cpp]
----
VkBool32 supported = VK_FALSE;
profile.CheckSupport(physicalDevice, &supported);

if (!supported) {
    // Get detailed report on what's not supported
    VkpProfileCapabilitiesReport report;
    profile.GetProfileCapabilitiesReport(physicalDevice, report);

    // Log the unsupported capabilities
    for (const auto& unsupported : report.unsupportedCapabilities) {
        LogWarning("Unsupported: " + unsupported);
    }

    // Fall back to a different profile or custom configuration
}
----

=== Version Compatibility Issues

When using profiles across different Vulkan SDK versions, you might encounter compatibility issues. To avoid these:

* Always use the profile definitions from the same SDK version as your Vulkan headers
* Be aware that profile definitions might evolve between SDK releases
* Consider bundling the profile JSON files with your application to ensure consistency

=== Integration with Validation Layers

Vulkan Profiles work well with validation layers, but there are some considerations:

* Enable the `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` layer during development
* Be aware that some validation warnings might be triggered for profile-enabled features that you're not explicitly using
* Use debug callbacks to filter validation messages if necessary

== Benefits of Using Vulkan Profiles

Using Vulkan Profiles offers several advantages:

1. *Simplified Development*
    - Reduces the complexity of checking for individual features and extensions
2. *Better Compatibility*
    - Ensures your application works consistently across different devices
3. *Future-Proofing*
    - Profiles evolve in a controlled manner, making it easier to adapt to new hardware
4. *Clear Communication*
    - Provides a common language for developers and hardware vendors to discuss capabilities
5. *Reduced Testing Burden*
    - Fewer device-specific code paths means less testing required
6. *Standardized Capabilities*
    - Provides a well-defined baseline that hardware vendors can target
7. *Easier Porting*
    - Simplifies the process of porting applications between different platforms

== Conclusion

Vulkan Profiles provide a powerful mechanism for targeting a consistent set of Vulkan capabilities across different devices. By using profiles, particularly the Android Baseline Profile for mobile development, developers can simplify their code, ensure better compatibility, and reduce the need for device-specific workarounds.

The profile system continues to evolve, with new profiles being defined to address emerging hardware capabilities and developer needs. By understanding how to effectively use profiles, create custom profiles, and integrate them into your applications, you can significantly streamline your Vulkan development process.
