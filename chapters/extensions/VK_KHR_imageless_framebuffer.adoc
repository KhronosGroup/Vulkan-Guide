[NOTE]

Promoted to core in Vulkan 1.2

When creating a `VkFramebuffer` you normally need to pass the ``VkImageView`s`` being used in `VkFramebufferCreateInfo::pAttachments`. Needing the `VkImageView` forces an application to make a framebuffer for each swapchain image. With `VK_KHR_imageless_framebuffer` the `VkImageView` information is given at `vkCmdBeginRenderPass` time instead. This means only one `VkFramebuffer` for all the swapchain images. It is important to notice that when the size of the swapchain changes, the `VkFramebuffer` will still need to be recreated to adjust information such as the `height` and `width`.

To use an imageless `VkFramebuffer`

  * Make sure the implementation has support for it by querying `VkPhysicalDeviceImagelessFramebufferFeatures::imagelessFramebuffer` or `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Features::imagelessFramebuffer`
  * Set the `VK_FRAMEBUFFER_CREATE_IMAGELESS_BIT` in `VkFramebufferCreateInfo::flags`
  * Include a `VkFramebufferAttachmentsCreateInfo` struct in the `VkFramebufferCreateInfo::pNext`
  * When beginning the render pass, pass in a `VkRenderPassAttachmentBeginInfo` structure into `VkRenderPassBeginInfo::pNext` with the compatible attachments
