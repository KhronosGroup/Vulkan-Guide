[[VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count]]
= VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count

[NOTE]
====
Promoted to core in Vulkan 1.2
====

Every call to `vkCmdDraw` consumes a set of parameters describing the draw call. To batch draw calls together the same parameters are stored in a `VkBuffer` in blocks of `VkDrawIndirectCommand`. Using `vkCmdDrawIndirect` allows you to invoke a `drawCount` number of draws, but the `drawCount` is needed at record time. The new `vkCmdDrawIndirectCount` call allows the `drawCount` to also be in a `VkBuffer`. This allows the value of `drawCount` to be dynamic and decided when the draw call is executed.

[NOTE]
====
The `vkCmdDrawIndirectCount` and `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount` function can be used if the extension is supported or if the `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Features::drawIndirectCount` feature bit is `true`.

The following diagram is to visualize the difference between `vkCmdDraw`, `vkCmdDrawIndirect`, and `vkCmdDrawIndirectCount`.
