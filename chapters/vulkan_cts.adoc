= Vulkan CTS

The Vulkan Conformance Tests Suite (CTS) is a set of tests used to verify the conformance of an implementation. A conformant implementation shows that it has successfully passed CTS and it is a valid implementation of Vulkan. A link:https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan[list of conformant products] is publicly available.

Any company with a conformant implementation may freely use the publicly released Vulkan specification to create a product. All implementations of the Vulkan API must be tested for conformance in the link:https://www.khronos.org/adopters[Khronos Vulkan Adopter Program] before the Vulkan name or logo may be used in association with an implementation of the API.

The link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS/tree/master/external/vulkancts[Vulkan CTS source code] is freely available and anyone is free to create and add a new test to the Vulkan CTS as long as they follow the link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS/wiki/Contributing[Contributing Wiki].

An application can query the version of CTS passed for an implementation using the link:https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#VkConformanceVersion[VkConformanceVersion] property via the `VK_KHR_driver_properties` extension (this was promoted to core in Vulkan 1.2).
