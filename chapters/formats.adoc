[[Formats]]
= Formats

Vulkan formats are used to describe how memory is laid out. This chapter aims to give a high-level overview of the variations of formats in Vulkan and some logistical information for how to use them. All details are already well specified in both the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#formats[Vulkan Spec format chapter] and the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/DataFormat/specs/1.3/dataformat.1.3.html[Khronos Data Format Specification].

The most common use case for a `VkFormat` is when creating a `VkImage`. Because the `VkFormat`&#8203;s are well defined, they are also used when describing the memory layout for things such as a `VkBufferView`, xref:{chapters}vertex_input_data_processing.adoc#input-attribute-format[vertex input attribute], link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#spirvenv-image-formats[mapping SPIR-V image formats], creating link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR.html[triangle geometry in a bottom-level acceleration structure], etc.

== Feature Support

It is important to understand that "format support" is not a single binary value per format, but rather each format has a set of link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkFormatFeatureFlagBits.html[VkFormatFeatureFlagBits] that each describes with features are supported for a format.

The supported formats may vary across implementations, but a link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html#features-required-format-support[minimum set of format features are guaranteed]. An application can link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html#formats-properties[query] for the supported format properties.

[NOTE]
====
Both link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2.html[VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2] and link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2.html[VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2] expose another way to query for format features.
====

=== Format Feature Query Example

In this example, the code will check if the `VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM` format supports being sampled from a `VkImage` created with `VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR` for `VkImageCreateInfo::tiling`. To do this, the code will query the `linearTilingFeatures` flags for `VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM` to see if the `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT` is supported by the implementation.

[source,cpp]
----
// Using core Vulkan 1.0
VkFormatProperties formatProperties;
vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties(physicalDevice, VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM, &formatProperties);
if ((formatProperties.linearTilingFeatures & VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT) != 0) {
    // supported
} else {
    // not supported
}
----

[source,cpp]
----
// Using core Vulkan 1.1 or VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
VkFormatProperties2 formatProperties2;
formatProperties2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FORMAT_PROPERTIES_2;
formatProperties2.pNext = nullptr; // used for possible extensions

vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2(physicalDevice, VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM, &formatProperties2);
if ((formatProperties2.formatProperties.linearTilingFeatures & VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT) != 0) {
    // supported
} else {
    // not supported
}
----

[source,cpp]
----
// Using VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2
VkFormatProperties3KHR formatProperties3;
formatProperties2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FORMAT_PROPERTIES_3_KHR;
formatProperties2.pNext = nullptr;

VkFormatProperties2 formatProperties2;
formatProperties2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FORMAT_PROPERTIES_2;
formatProperties2.pNext = &formatProperties3;

vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2(physicalDevice, VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM, &formatProperties2);
if ((formatProperties3.linearTilingFeatures & VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_2_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT_KHR) != 0) {
    // supported
} else {
    // not supported
}

== Variations of Formats

Formats come in many variations, most can be grouped by the https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#_identification_of_formats[name of the format]. When dealing with images, the  link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkImageAspectFlagBits.html[VkImageAspectFlagBits] values are used to represent which part of the data is being accessed for operations such as clears and copies.

=== Color

Format with a `R`, `G`, `B` or `A` component and accessed with the `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT`

=== Depth and Stencil

Formats with a `D` or `S` component. These formats are link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#formats-depth-stencil[considered opaque] and have special rules when it comes to link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkBufferImageCopy[copy to and from] depth/stencil images.

Some formats have both a depth and stencil component and can be accessed separately with `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT` and `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT`.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_separate_depth_stencil_layouts.html[VK_KHR_separate_depth_stencil_layouts] and link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_separate_stencil_usage.html[VK_EXT_separate_stencil_usage], which are both promoted to Vulkan 1.2, can be used to have finer control between the depth and stencil components.

More information about depth format can also be found in the xref:{chapters}depth.adoc#formats[depth chapter].

=== Compressed

=== Planar

link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion.html[VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion] and link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_ycbcr_2plane_444_formats.html[VK_EXT_ycbcr_2plane_444_formats] add xref:{chapters}VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion.adoc#formats[multi-planar formats] to Vulkan. The planes can be accessed separately with `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_0_BIT`, `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_1_BIT`, and `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_2_BIT`.

=== Packed

link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#formats-packed[Packed formats] are for the purposes of address alignment. As an example, `VK_FORMAT_A8B8G8R8_UNORM_PACK32` and `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` might seem very similar, but whe using the formula from the link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fxvertex-input-extraction[Vertex Input Extraction section of the spec]

____
attribAddress = bufferBindingAddress + vertexOffset + attribDesc.offset;
____

For `VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM` the `attribAddress` has to be a multiple of the component size (8 bits) while `VK_FORMAT_A8B8G8R8_UNORM_PACK32` has to be a multiple of the packed size (32 bits).

=== External

Currently only supported with the `VK_ANDROID_external_memory_android_hardware_buffer` extension. This extension allows Android applications to import implementation-defined external formats to be used with a xref:{chapters}VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion.adoc[VkSamplerYcbcrConversion]. There are many restrictions what are allowed with these external formats which are link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#memory-external-android-hardware-buffer-external-formats[documented in the spec].
