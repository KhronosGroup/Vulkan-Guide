= Enabling Features

This section goes over the logistics for enabling features.

== Category of Features

All features in Vulkan can be categorized/found in 3 sections

  1. Core 1.0 Features
  ** These are the set of features that were available from the initial 1.0 release of Vulkan. The list of features can be found in link:https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/features.html#VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures[VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures]
  2. Future Core Version Features
  ** With Vulkan 1.1+ some new features were added to the core version of Vulkan. To keep the size of `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures` backward compatible, new structs were created to hold the grouping of features.
  ** link:https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/features.html#VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features[VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features]
  ** link:https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/features.html#VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Features[VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Features]
  3. Extension Features
  ** Sometimes extensions contain features in order to enable certain aspects of the extension. These are easily found as they are all labeled as `VkPhysicalDevice[ExtensionName]Features`

== How to Enable the Features

All features must be enabled at `VkDevice` creation time inside the link:https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#VkDeviceCreateInfo[VkDeviceCreateInfo] struct.

[NOTE]
====
Don't forget to query first with `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` or `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2`
====

For the Core 1.0 Features, this is as simple as setting `VkDeviceCreateInfo::pEnabledFeatures` with the features desired to be turned on.

[source,cpp]
----
VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures features = {};
vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures(physical_device, &features);

// Logic if feature is not supported
if (features.robustBufferAccess == VK_FALSE) {
}

VkDeviceCreateInfo info = {};
info.pEnabledFeatures = &features;
----

For **all features**, including the Core 1.0 Features, use `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` to pass into `VkDeviceCreateInfo.pNext`

[source,cpp]
----
VkPhysicalDeviceShaderDrawParametersFeatures ext_feature = {};
ext_feature.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADER_DRAW_PARAMETERS_FEATURES;

VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 physical_features2 = {};
physical_features2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2;
physical_features2.pNext = &ext_feature;

vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2(physical_device, &physical_features2);

// Logic if feature is not supported
if (ext_feature.shaderDrawParameters == VK_FALSE) {
}

VkDeviceCreateInfo info = {};
info.pNext = &physical_features2;
----

The same works for the "`Future Core Version Features`" too.

[source,cpp]
----
VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features features11 = {};
features11.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_VULKAN_1_1_FEATURES;

VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 physical_features2 = {};
physical_features2.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2;
physical_features2.pNext = &features11;

vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2(physical_device, &physical_features2);

// Logic if feature is not supported
if (features11.shaderDrawParameters == VK_FALSE) {
}

VkDeviceCreateInfo info = {};
info.pNext = &physical_features2;
----
