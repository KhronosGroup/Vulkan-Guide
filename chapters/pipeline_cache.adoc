= Pipeline Cache

Pipeline caching is a technique used with link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/vkspec.html#VkPipelineCache[VkPipelineCache] objects to reuse pipelines that have already been created. Pipeline creation can be somewhat costly - it has to compile the shaders at creation time for example. The big advantage of a pipeline cache is that the pipeline state can be saved to a file to be used between runs of an application, eliminating some of the costly parts of creation. There is a great Khronos presentation on pipeline caching from link:https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2016-siggraph/3D-BOF-SIGGRAPH_Jul16.pdf[SIGGRAPH 2016] (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owuJRPKIUAg&t=1045s[video]) starting on slide 140.

While pipeline caches are an important tool, it is important to create a robust system for them which Arseny Kapoulkine talks about in his link:https://zeux.io/2019/07/17/serializing-pipeline-cache/[blog post].

To illustrate the performance gain and see a reference implementation of pipeline caches Khronos offers a link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/master/samples/performance/pipeline_cache[sample and tutorial].
