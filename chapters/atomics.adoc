[[atomics]]
= Atomics

The purpose of this chapter is to help users understand the various features Vulkan exposes for atomic operations.

== Variations of Atomics

To better understand the different extensions, it is first important to be aware of the various types of atomics exposed.

  * Type
  ** `float`
  ** `int`
  * Width
  ** `16 bit`
  ** `32 bit`
  ** `64 bit`
  * Operations
  ** loads
  ** stores
  ** exchange
  ** add
  ** min
  ** max
  ** etc.
  * Storage Class
  ** `StorageBuffer` or `Uniform` (buffer)
  ** `Workgroup` (shared memory)
  ** `Image` (image or sparse image)

== Baseline Support

With Vulkan 1.0 and no extensions, an application is allowed to use `32-bit int` type for atomics. This can be used for all supported SPIR-V operations (load, store, exchange, etc). SPIR-V contains some atomic operations that are guarded with the `Kernel` capability and are not currently allowed in Vulkan.

=== Atomic Counters

While both GLSL and SPIR-V support the use of atomic counters, Vulkan does **not** expose the `AtomicStorage` SPIR-V capability needed to use the `AtomicCounter` storage class. It was decided that an app can just use `OpAtomicIAdd` and `OpAtomicISub` with the value `1` to achieve the same results.

=== Expanding Atomic support

The current extensions that expose additional support for atomics are:

Each explained in more details below.

== VK_KHR_shader_atomic_int64

[NOTE]
====
Promoted to core in Vulkan 1.2

link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/ext/GL_EXT_shader_atomic_int64.txt[GLSL - GL_EXT_shader_atomic_int64]
====

This extension allows for `64-bit int` atomic operations for **buffers** and **shared memory**. If the `Int64Atomics` SPIR-V capability is declared, all supported SPIR-V operations can be used with `64-bit int`.

The two feature bits, `shaderBufferInt64Atomics` and `shaderSharedInt64Atomics`, are used to query what storage classes are supported for `64-bit int` atomics.

  * `shaderBufferInt64Atomics` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedInt64Atomics` - shared memory

The `shaderBufferInt64Atomics` is always guaranteed to be supported if using Vulkan 1.2 or the extension is exposed.

====

This extension allows for `64-bit int` atomic operations for **images** and **sparse images**. If the `Int64Atomics` and `Int64ImageEXT` SPIR-V capability is declared, all supported SPIR-V operations can be used with `64-bit int` on images.

=== Image vs Sparse Image support

This extension exposes both a `shaderImageInt64Atomics` and `sparseImageInt64Atomics` feature bit. The `sparseImage*` feature is an additional feature bit and is only allowed to be used if the `shaderImage*` bit is enabled as well. Some hardware has a hard time doing atomics on images with xref:{chapters}sparse_resources.adoc#sparse-resources[sparse resources], therefor the atomic feature is split up to allow **sparse images** as an additional feature an implementation can expose.

====

This extension allows for `float` atomic operations for **buffers**, **shared memory**, **images**, and **sparse images**. Only a subset of operations is supported for `float` types with this extension.

The extension lists many feature bits. One way to group them is by `*Float*Atomics` and `*Float*AtomicAdd`:

  * The `*Float*Atomics` features allow for the use of `OpAtomicStore`, `OpAtomicLoad`, and `OpAtomicExchange` for `float` types.
  ** Note the `OpAtomicCompareExchange` "`exchange`" operation is not included as the SPIR-V spec only allows `int` types for it.
  * The `*Float*AtomicAdd` features allow the use of the two extended SPIR-V operations `AtomicFloat32AddEXT` and `AtomicFloat64AddEXT`.

From here the rest of the permutations of features fall into the grouping of `32-bit float` support:

  * `shaderBufferFloat32*` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat32*` - shared memory
  * `shaderImageFloat32*` - images
  * `sparseImageFloat32*` - sparse images

and `64-bit float` support:

  * `shaderBufferFloat64*` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat64*` - shared memory

[NOTE]
====
OpenGLES link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_shader_image_atomic.txt[OES_shader_image_atomic] allowed the use of atomics on `r32f` for `imageAtomicExchange`. For porting, an application will want to check for `shaderImageFloat32Atomics` support to be able to do the same in Vulkan.

This extension adds 2 additional sets of features missing in `VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float`

First, it adds `16-bit floats` for both **buffers** and **shared memory** in the same fashion as found above for `VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float`.

  * `shaderBufferFloat16*` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat16*` - shared memory

Second, it adds `float` support for `min` and `max` atomic operations (`OpAtomicFMinEXT` and `OpAtomicFMaxEXT`)

For `16-bit float` support (with `AtomicFloat16MinMaxEXT` capability):

  * `shaderBufferFloat16AtomicMinMax` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat16AtomicMinMax` - shared memory

For `32-bit float` support (with `AtomicFloat32MinMaxEXT` capability):

  * `shaderBufferFloat32AtomicMinMax` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat32AtomicMinMax` - shared memory
  * `shaderImageFloat32AtomicMinMax` - images
  * `sparseImageFloat32AtomicMinMax` - sparse images

For `64-bit float` support (with `AtomicFloat64MinMaxEXT` capability):

  * `shaderBufferFloat64AtomicMinMax` - buffers
  * `shaderSharedFloat64AtomicMinMax` - shared memory
