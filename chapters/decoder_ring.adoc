= Vulkan Decoder Ring

This section provides a mapping between the Vulkan term for a concept and the terminology used in other APIs. It is organized in alphabetical order by Vulkan term. If you are searching for the Vulkan equivalent of a concept used in an API you know, you can find the term you know in this list and then search the xref:{chapters}vulkan_spec.adoc#vulkan-spec[Vulkan specification] for the corresponding Vulkan term.

[NOTE]
====
Not everything will be a perfect 1:1 match, the goal is to give a rough idea where to start looking in the spec.
