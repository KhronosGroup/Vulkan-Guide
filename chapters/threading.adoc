[[threading]]
= Threading

One of the big differences between Vulkan and OpenGL is that Vulkan is not limited to a single-threaded state machine system. Before running off to implement threads in an application, it is important to understand how threading works in Vulkan.

The Vulkan Spec link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/vkspec.html#fundamentals-threadingbehavior[Threading Behavior section] explains in detail how applications are in charge of managing all _externally synchronized_ elements of Vulkan. It is important to realize that multithreading in Vulkan only provides host-side scaling, as anything interacting with the device still needs to be xref:{chapters}sychronization.adoc#synchronization[synchronized correctly]

Vulkan implementations are not supposed to introduce any multi-threading, so if an app wants multi-CPU performance, the app is in charge of managing the threading.

== Command Pools

link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/vkspec.html#commandbuffers-pools[Command Pools] are a system to allow recording command buffers across multiple threads. A single command pool must be _externally synchronized_; it must not be accessed simultaneously from multiple threads. By using a separate command pool in each host-thread the application can create multiple command buffers in parallel without any costly locks.

The idea is command buffers can be recorded on multiple threads while having a relatively light thread handle the submissions.

Khronos' link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/tree/master/samples/performance/command_buffer_usage[sample and tutorial] show in more detail how to record command buffers in parallel.

== Descriptor Pools

link:https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3/html/vkspec.html#VkDescriptorPool[Descriptor Pools] are used to allocate, free, reset, and update descriptor sets. By creating multiple descriptor pools, each application host thread is able to manage a descriptor set in each descriptor pool at the same time.
